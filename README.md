Legit is a Spotify powered quiz app that will test you on whether or not you know your favorite songs. By integrating with your Spotify account, Legit will pull in your public playlists with at least 20 songs. You can then select from these playlists to play the game. The game's difficulty levels span from pedestrian(5 seconds of a song played) to masochistic(0.25 seconds of a song played). 10 songs will be played for the difficulty duration you have chosen. Let's see if you get any right. Are you legit?
